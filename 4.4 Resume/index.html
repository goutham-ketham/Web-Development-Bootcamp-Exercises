    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Goutham, I am currently pursuing my BTech in CCE in Amrita Chennai campus,and i have great interests in development, i thrive on challenges and opportunities that come into my way and i often like to take on projects to improve my skills and abilities in developing field,
      i'm profficient in java, muSQL. one of the projects that i did recently was called "A transparent framework for proritizong civic complaints", this project is about classification and prioritizing civic complaints like garbage overflow, street light malfuntion, broken pipeline, street damage etc, for this project i used nyc 311 service requests dataset, this data set consists of non emergency service requests, current systems only classify the complaints in which department to is going to handle the issue, curreltly there is no system that can prioritize the complaints in each department.
